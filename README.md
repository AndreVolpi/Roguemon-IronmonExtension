## Roguemon Extension for Ironmon Tracker

This is an extension for the [Gen 3 Ironmon Tracker](https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker), intended to add support for the [Roguemon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uU1KeFB_kjIULXArfwdLjZrNV_D_IXi0h2wD_nP6erQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) ruleset by Crozwords.

This extension only works with Pokemon FireRed, and is intended for use with the [National Dex patch](https://github.com/CyanSMP64/NatDexExtension/releases/tag/v1.1.3) although most of the features still work without it.

## Features
- Automatic tracking and display of HP and status caps.
- Automatic prize rolls when a milestone is met. The player will be prompted to choose one of 3 prizes; if the prize provides an item, that item will automatically be deposited in the bag.
- Prizes that provide permanent abilities, or abilities that can be saved, are tracked and displayed on-screen, however their effects will need to be carried out manually by the player.
- At any time, the player may press the ! button on the main screen to view the list of stored prizes, and remove them when they have been used.
- Pokemon with item-based evolutions that have been changed to Moon Stone will display as Moon Stone. The tracker will offer the player a Moon Stone at the appropriate times.
- Segments are automatically tracked, and the main screen will display total and mandatory trainers in the current segment, as well as the next segment when the player is between segments.

## Installation
Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/something-smart/Roguemon-IronmonExtension/releases/latest) and download the zip file. Place the contents of the zip file in the "extensions" folder inside the tracker folder. Then go to the Extensions menu in the tracker, and click "Install New", and the Roguemon extension should show up.
